# Pipedream Roadmap

This repo operates as a public roadmap for [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com).

We're eager to build a developer integration platform that solves real problems for you, and we want to respond directly to your requests and feedback. We use Github Issues to track this feedback.

While Pipedream publishes some open source components (for example, the [SDK](#sdk)), the Pipedream platform itself is not open source. This repo contains no source code, but functions as a way for you to get visibility into what we're currently working on and to suggest your own ideas for how to improve Pipedream.

## Adding a new issue

Before adding an issue, please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/roadmap/issues) to see if a similar request already exists. If so, please [add a reaction](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-conversations-on-github) to that request or comment with your specific use case. This helps us prioritize requests based on demand.
