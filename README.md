# Pipedream Roadmap

This repo operates as a public roadmap for [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com).

We're eager to build a developer integration platform that solves real problems for you, and we want to respond directly to your requests and feedback. We use Github Issues to track this feedback. If you have a feature request or bug to report, read the relevant instructions below for how to raise an issue 

If you have a feature request or bug to file for the Pipedream SDK, please do so in the [SDK repo](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/sdk).

Before adding an issue, please search existing issues to see if a similar request already exists. If so, please add a `+1` to that request or comment with your specific use case. This helps us prioritize requests based on demand.
