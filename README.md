## Pipedream Roadmap

This repo serves as a public roadmap for [https://pipedream.com](https://pipedream.com). You can view the current roadmap at [this project board](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/roadmap/projects/1).

We're eager to build a developer integration platform that solves real problems for you, and we want to respond directly to your feedback. We use Github Issues to track this feedback.

If you don't know whether you've found a bug or want to talk to our team about a new feature in more depth, please [join our public Slack community](https://pipedream.com/community) and send us a note.

While Pipedream publishes some open source tools (for example, the [SDK](#sdk)), the Pipedream platform itself is not open source. This repo contains no source code, but provides you visibility into what we're working on and gives you a way to suggest your own ideas for how to improve Pipedream.

## Adding a new issue

Before adding an issue, please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/roadmap/issues) to see if a similar request already exists, or reach out on our [Slack community](https://pipedream.com/community). 

If an issue already exists, please [add a reaction](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-conversations-on-github) to that request or comment with your specific use case. This helps us prioritize requests based on demand.

If an issue _doesn't_ yet exist, please use these templates to create one:
